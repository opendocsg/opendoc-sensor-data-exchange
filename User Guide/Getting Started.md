You can send a request through email to <sense@tech.gov.sg> to change the role as Administrator to access Administrative features.

**Step 4:** As a Publisher to publish your relevant information, you must first create your Project to create a topic. You can   also subscribe to your own topic. 

   A topic cannot be duplicated and cannot published and subscribed to the same project again. 
   
   Both Publisher and Subscriber can create a project, but only the Publisher can create topic. 
   
**Here is an example use case scenario:**

*Where:*



Agency A - For example, National Environment Agency (NEA)

Agency B - For example, Land Transportation Authority (LTA)
   

*Scenario:*

Agency A will publish and share environment-related information about "Rainfall". 

In SDX portal, Agency A will create a Project "Rainfall" and create topic about total rainfall for the month and publish it. 

A subscription approval is needed for another agency (Agency B) to subscribes to this topic.
