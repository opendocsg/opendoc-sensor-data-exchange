# Introduction #

**SENSE/SDX 2.0 (Sensors Data Exchange)** is a centralized data exchange platform for Whole-of-Government (WOG) to provide seamless data sharing and management, and encompass public, private and industrial internet-of-things (IoT) sensors.
This system enables government agencies to:

- Publish and subscribe (near) real-time sensor data using a self-service portal both on-premise and in the commercial cloud.
- Share unclassified (potentially up to restricted) sensor data with government sector organisations and individuals.

For example, the National Environment Agency (NEA) may publish and share environment-related information such as weather and air quality. In SENSE/SDX 2.0, a government agency can act as a publisher of information to publish information.
